A simple way to code in both R and Python in R server is to define the coding chunk with either "{r}" or "{python}".

You can switch back and forth between R and Python by using the reticulate package in R.  
```{r}
library(reticulate)
me<-"Hailey"
```

To pull R-defined objects when coding in python just write "r.___".
```{python}
me="Fanucchi"
print(r.me,me)
```

To code Python-defined objects when coding in R just write "py$___".
```{r}
cat(c(me,py$me)) 
```
