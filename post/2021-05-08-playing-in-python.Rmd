I have learned that coding in python is really not that different than coding in R. 

One big difference is that in python when you index the first position is the 0th position. Here is an example:
```{python}
listA=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
listB=['I','II','III','IV','V','VI','VII', 'VIII', 'IX', 'X']
listA
listB

listA[0]
listA[1]
listA[9]

listB[0]
listB[1]
listB[9]
```


You can use python as a calculator:
```{python}
listA[4]+listA[0]

1456/3.5
16+4
13-3
```
